I went through Mrs Shearsâ€™ gate, closing it behind me. 
I walked onto her lawn and knelt beside the dog. 
I put my hand on the muzzle of the dog. It was still warm.

The dog was called Wellington. 
It belonged to Mrs Shears who was our friend. She lived on the opposite side of the road,
 two houses to the left.

Wellington was a poodle. Not one of the small poodles that have hairstyles 
but a big poodle. It had curly black fur, but when you got close you could see that 
the skin underneath the fur was a very pale yellow, like chicken.

I stroked Wellington and wondered who had killed him, and why.
